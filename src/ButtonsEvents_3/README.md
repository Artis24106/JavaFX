Event handling can be done in many different ways, in this example I will be showing two types of event handling when a button is clicked.

* `ButtonsEvents_3_1` package uses Method reference.
* `ButtonsEvent_3_2` package uses lambda expression.
* `ButtonsEvent_3_3` package uses lambda expression to update a Text field on the GUI.
